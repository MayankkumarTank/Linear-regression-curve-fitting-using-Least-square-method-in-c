# Linear-regression-curve-fitting-using-Least-square-method-in-c

So, This project is helps to find the second order equation and also it will able to find the coffiecient of that equation.

First you have to give the certain amount of point means (x,y)
So, It will find those coffiecient and equation.
After that if you provide x then it will predict the value of Y.

To run this project First start the Linear_regression.c which includes the whole c programs.

**So, Enjoy the world of prediction.
